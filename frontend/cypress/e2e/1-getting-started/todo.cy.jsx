/// <reference types="cypress" />

// Welcome to Cypress!
//
// This spec file contains a variety of sample tests
// for a todo list app that are designed to demonstrate
// the power of writing tests in Cypress.
//
// To learn more about how Cypress works and
// what makes it such an awesome testing tool,
// please read our getting started guide:
// https://on.cypress.io/introduction-to-cypress

describe("example to-do app", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Cypress starts out with a blank slate for each test
    // so we must tell it to visit our website with the `cy.visit()` command.
    // Since we want to visit the same URL at the start of all our tests,
    // we include it in our beforeEach function so that it runs before each test
    cy.visit("https://example.cypress.io/todo");
  });

  it("displays two todo items by default", () => {
    // We use the `cy.get()` command to get all elements that match the selector.
    // Then, we use `should` to assert that there are two matched items,
    // which are the two default items.
    cy.get(".todo-list li").should("have.length", 2);

    // We can go even further and check that the default todos each contain
    // the correct text. We use the `first` and `last` functions
    // to get just the first and last matched elements individually,
    // and then perform an assertion with `should`.
    cy.get(".todo-list li").first().should("have.text", "Pay electric bill");
    cy.get(".todo-list li").last().should("have.text", "Walk the dog");
  });

  it("can add new todo items", () => {
    // We'll store our item text in a variable so we can reuse it
    const newItem = "Feed the cat";

    // Let's get the input element and use the `type` command to
    // input our new list item. After typing the content of our item,
    // we need to type the enter key as well in order to submit the input.
    // This input has a data-test attribute so we'll use that to select the
    // element in accordance with best practices:
    // https://on.cypress.io/selecting-elements
    cy.get("[data-test=new-todo]").type(`${newItem}{enter}`);

    // Now that we've typed our new item, let's check that it actually was added to the list.
    // Since it's the newest item, it should exist as the last element in the list.
    // In addition, with the two default items, we should have a total of 3 elements in the list.
    // Since assertions yield the element that was asserted on,
    // we can chain both of these assertions together into a single statement.
    cy.get(".todo-list li")
      .should("have.length", 3)
      .last()
      .should("have.text", newItem);
  });

  it("can check off an item as completed", () => {
    // In addition to using the `get` command to get an element by selector,
    // we can also use the `contains` command to get an element by its contents.
    // However, this will yield the <label>, which is lowest-level element that contains the text.
    // In order to check the item, we'll find the <input> element for this <label>
    // by traversing up the dom to the parent element. From there, we can `find`
    // the child checkbox <input> element and use the `check` command to check it.
    cy.contains("Pay electric bill")
      .parent()
      .find("input[type=checkbox]")
      .check();

    // Now that we've checked the button, we can go ahead and make sure
    // that the list element is now marked as completed.
    // Again we'll use `contains` to find the <label> element and then use the `parents` command
    // to traverse multiple levels up the dom until we find the corresponding <li> element.
    // Once we get that element, we can assert that it has the completed class.
    cy.contains("Pay electric bill")
      .parents("li")
      .should("have.class", "completed");
  });
});
